    1. Even or Odd Checker
        ◦ Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number. The program should then print whether the number is even or odd.
        ◦ Hint: Use the modulus operator % to determine if the number is even or odd.
    2. Largest Number in a List
        ◦ Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest number in the list.
        ◦ Hint: Iterate through the list and keep track of the largest number found so far.
    3. Sum of Numbers in a Range
        ◦ Write a Python program that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to a number provided by the user.
        ◦ Hint: Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to the user-provided number and keep a running total.
    4. Multiplication Table
        ◦ Write a Python program that prints the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 10.
        ◦ Hint: Use nested loops to generate the table.
    5. Factorial Calculator
        ◦ Write a Python function that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.
        ◦ Hint: Use a while loop or a for loop to calculate the factorial.
    6. Count Vowels in a String
        ◦ Write a Python function that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the string.
        ◦ Hint: Iterate through the string and count the vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
    7. Palindrome Checker
        ◦ Write a Python program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
        ◦ Hint: Compare the string to its reverse.
    8. Prime Number Checker
        ◦ Write a Python function that takes a number as an argument and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
        ◦ Hint: Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.
    9. Temperature Converter
        ◦ Write a Python program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The program should prompt the user for a temperature in Celsius and then print the temperature in Fahrenheit.
        ◦ Hint: Use the formula F = C * 9/5 + 32.
    10. Remove Duplicates from a List
        ◦ Write a Python function that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with duplicates removed.
        ◦ Hint: Use a loop to iterate through the list and add elements to a new list if they are not already present.
